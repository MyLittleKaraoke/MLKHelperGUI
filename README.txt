Binary is in the directory MLKHelperGUI\MLKHelperGUI\bin\Release.
It's recommended to copy it in the MLK path, then open the .mlk provided to associate it.

.mlk are simple tar, it should represent the root of the songs folder, if you want to copy a new songs in "Downloaded Songs\New Songs\(note.txt,...)" , you need to have the "Downloaded Songs\New Songs" folder inside it!

I recommend using the file extention .tar.mlk, but it's not mandatory.
